	The solutions are correct, i.e. they do the job. I would put the Cons

	It depends on the nature of the Stream, but if we are expecting for it
	to have a lot of elements, it makes sense to first match if we have
	an element and then if the Stream is empty, as it is most likely we
	will hit the first case more often.
	The _ in the second is just because we do not care about it, we know
	it is Empty (as there are only two constructors), however your solution
	makes this explicit.
